            <h2 style="color: aliceblue"><i><u>How long it takes the Suns light to reach earth.</u></i></h2>
            <p style="color: aliceblue">It takes the Suns light <b>approximately 8 minutes</b> to reach earth, 
                so technically we're seeing the sun as it was 8 minutes ago!</p>

            <h3 style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 25px;"><i><u>How sound works in space.</u></i></h3>
            <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 15px;">Well, It doesn't, because space is a Vacuum, <b>sound can't actually travel</b>.
                The way sound travels through the vibration of atoms and molocules (such as air or water) so since none of that really exists in space
                no sound travels. though scientist can use devices to form an idea of how somthings may sound.

            <h4 style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 25px;"><i><u>Whats a Barycenter?</u></i></h4>
            <p style="color: aliceblue; font-size: 15px;"> The <b>Barycenter</b> is the common center of mass in the solar system. Basically
                think of it like a sludge hammar, instead of being able to balance it where it's center is, you can only
                balance it where the mass is centered, which would be by the hammars head. Thats how gravity works in our
                solar system to so technically the sun isn't in the center of our galaxy but its mass is so large that
                we just say it is. but basically we can compare the sun and other planets to the sledgehammar.

            <p style="color: aliceblue;">The purpose of this sight was to share cool space facts I knew while trying out CSS.
